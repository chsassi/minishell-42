### Execution:

```bash
./minishell
```

This command starts your Minishell, ready to interpret user commands in a manner similar to Bash or Zsh.

Features:

Built-in Commands: Implement basic commands like cd, echo, pwd, export, unset, env, and exit.
Redirections: Handle redirections such as >, <, >>, and << (heredoc).
Pipes: Enable piping between commands to allow for complex command chaining.
Environment Variables: Support environment variable expansion within commands.
Signal Handling: Manage signals like CTRL+C, CTRL+D, and CTRL+\ gracefully, ensuring a responsive user experience.

Example Usage
Running a basic command
```bash
$ echo "Hello, world!"
Hello, world!
```

Using pipes and redirection
```bash
$ ls -l | grep ".c" > c_files.txt
```
Environment variable expansion
```bash
$ export NAME=Minishell
$ echo "Welcome to $NAME!"
```
